    "name": "Tool-Assisted Moral and Ethical Simulations",
    "description": "As part of my final year university group project, we developed a framework for studying human morality using AI-driven analysis. Participants engaged in VR simulations of classic moral dilemmas, such as the Trolley Problem, to enhance immersion and data validity. Our system then classified moral decision-making styles using machine learning, identifying patterns and constructing neural networks to categorise users.",
